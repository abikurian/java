Exercise No 4
Inheritance
Aim: Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following
members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named
'print-Salary()' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager'
inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members
'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and
salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the
same. (Exercise to understand inheritance)
Algorithm:
Step 1: Create a class Employee with given variables and method- print-salary() to print the
salary..
Step 2 Create two subclasses of class Employee named Officer and Manager. Include the
variable 'specialization' in Officer class and ‘department’ in Manager class
Step 3: Create a class with the main function. Inside the main function do the following steps.
Step 4: Create an object of Officer class and assign appropriate values to the variables.
Step 5: Create an object of Manager class and assign appropriate values to the variables.
Step 6: Print the values of variables using objects.
Step 7: Invoke the function print-salary() using objects to print the salary.
